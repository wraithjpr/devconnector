Do not put sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, etc. in any config files in the folder, so that they are never published up to GitHub.
See [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository/).
There is a template for keys.js at keys.js.template. The real keys.js is in the ./config/sensitive folder, which is named in .gitignore.
